water	H2O	Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Oxygen	Water (H2O) is the most abundant compound on Earth's surface, covering 70 percent of the planet. In nature, water exists in liquid, solid, and gaseous states. It is in dynamic equilibrium  between the liquid and gas states at standard temperature and pressure.	18.01528(33) g/mol	1 kg/L
Carbon dioxide	CO2	Carbon-Oxygen-Oxygen	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is composed of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in the Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume.	44.01 g·mol−1	1562 kg/m3
Methane	CH4	Carbon-Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen	Methane (CH4) is a chemical compound with one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen. It is the simplest alkane and the main component of natural gas.The relative abundance of methane makes it an attractive fuel.In its natural state, methane is found both below ground, and under the sea floor, where it often finds its way to the surface and in the atmosphere of Earth where it is known as atmospheric methane.	16.04 g·mol−1	0.656 g/L at 25 °C
Ammonia	NH3	Nitrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen	Ammonia(NH3) or azane is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building-block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals and is used in many commercial cleaning products. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous.	17.031 g/Molar	0.86 kg/m3
Ethylene C2H4	Carbon-Carbon-Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Hydrogen	Ethylene(C2H4 or H2C=CH2) is a hydrocarbon which has the formula C. It is a colorless flammable gas with a faint "sweet and musky" odor when pure. It is the simplest alkene and the second simplest unsaturated hydrocarbon after acetylene.Ethylene is widely used in chemical industry and is also an important natural plant hormone, used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits.	28.05 g/Molar	1.178 kg/m3 at 15 °C
